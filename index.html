    <h1 style="text-align: center;">CEDRIC WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO??</h1>
    <p>On this here website we have three things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a>Things we know about Cedric</a></li>
      <li><a>Things we think Cedric would like to do</a></li>
      <li><a>What Cedric thinks about those things</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a place to inspire the uncertian youth, and Cedric is just a symbol, representation of the whole. Maybe through our individual experiences we can eventually share something that strikes a chord with the entirety of unsure youth, cultivating a better future for everyone. If not, my intentions are still pure.</p>
